# Buy-Sell_Website_SFSU
Website development project, created as a part of the B.S. program at San Francisco State University. The purpose of the project was to design a website intended for SFSU students to post items for sale, intended to be purchased by other SFSU students only. The files displayed in this repository are only for showcasing purposes, and therefore only encompass a very small part of the complete project. 
The project was created in a team of 6 students, using Git and Github to work remotely the majority of the semester and I used Netbeans together with the CodeIgniter framework to commit files to the project. 

Technologies and skills used: SSH, BASH, PHP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery, SQL, MySQL Workbench, MVC, SCRUM, Team of 6, Git & Github, LAMP, AWS, CodeIgniter, Netbeans
