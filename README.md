# Buy-Sell_Website_SFSU
Website development project, created as part of B.S. at San Francisco State University. The purpose of the project was to design a website intended for SFSU students to post items for sale, intended to be purchased by other SFSU students only. The files displayed in this repository are only for showcasing purposes, and therefore only encompass a very small part of the complete project.
